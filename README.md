# reduced_echelon

You can open the program as is and input the matrix you want to reduce. I'm currently workig on making it compatible as an imported library

In the py file, there is a variable named "digits" where you can change the amount of digits show. Default is 3.
Digits shown does not change any of the math.

You can soon use the program externally for simplifying matrixes, just by importing it and writig something like 
"new_matrix = reduced_echelon.reduce(old_matrix)"
