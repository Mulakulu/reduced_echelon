# reduced_echelon

In the py file, there is a variable named "digits" where you can change the amount of digits show. Default is 3.
Digits shown does not change any of the math.

You can use the program externally for simplifying matrixes, just by importing it and writig something like 
"new_matrix = reduced_echelon.reduce(old_matrix)"
